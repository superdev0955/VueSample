## Infrastructure restructuring (reorganization by functional unit and page unit)
- It must have a register structure that includes low-level components.
- Along with modularization, components related to UI are selected and used separately.
- Naming of sub-registries must be regulated and functional units must be made unique.

## Naming rules of Component
- It is better to use one approach for file names. (PascalCase, kebab-case, camelCase, snake_case)
- For components with the same category, a prefix related to the parent must be used.
- For components that are used uniquely, it is better to use them with “The” attached.
- For sub-registries, different naming rules must be applied for each functional group. Import/export the component through index.js.

## Mockup data composition
- Using a static data type such as json can ensure code simplicity in page rendering and component configuration for initial development.
- For mock materials, you should create groups according to usage and perform basic management (it is recommended to delete unused files) in a register called constants.
- It is more convenient to use the import/export function using js data, and it is better to configure mock data by page.

## Annotate
- The purpose of component use must be specified.
- By using VS-code extensions such as Todo tree, basic error tracking and development synchronization can be guaranteed.

## Code formatting and error handling through VScode
- formatting rules / vue code rules
- prettier
- eslint
- Volar
- Highlight
- Todo Tree
- .vscode/settings.json
